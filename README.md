## Ⓜ️ About OpenIM

OpenIM is a service platform specifically designed for integrating chat, audio-video calls, notifications, and AI chatbots into applications. It provides a range of powerful APIs and Webhooks, enabling developers to easily incorporate these interactive features into their applications. OpenIM is not a standalone chat application, but rather serves as a platform to support other applications in achieving rich communication functionalities. The following diagram illustrates the interaction between AppServer, AppClient, OpenIMServer, and OpenIMSDK to explain in detail.
